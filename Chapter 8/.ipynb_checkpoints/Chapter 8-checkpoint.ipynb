    "\n",
    "- __In order to make a prediction for a given observation__, we typically use the `mean or the mode` of the `training observations` in the `region to which it belongs`. Since the set of splitting rules used to segment the predictor space can be `summarized` in a `tree`, these types of `approaches` are `known` as ___`decision tree` methods___.\n",

    "- however they're not typically competitive with the best supervised learning approaches, such as Ridge,Lasso,etc (from Chapter 6 & 7)\n",

At a `given internal node`, the label (of the form $X_{j} < t_{k} $) `indicates` the `left-hand branch` emanating from that `split`, and the `right-hand branch` corresponds to  $X_{j} \\ge t_{k} $.\n",

The `left-hand branch corresponds` to $Years\\lt 4.5$, and the `right-hand branch` corresponds to $Years\\ge4.5$. The tree has two internal nodes and three terminal nodes, or leaves. The number in each leaf is the mean of the response for the observations that fall there."
